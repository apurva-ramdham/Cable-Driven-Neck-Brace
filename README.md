# Cable Driven Neck Brace

- Modeled Neck Brace motion manipulation models in Robotics and Rehabilitation Lab for patients suffering from ALS, Parkinson and other neurological disorders involving reduced muscle function
- Developed forward and inverse kinematics for rigid link 4-RPR (Revolute - Prismatic - Revolute) manipulation in 2D space for Neck Brace mechanism on MATLAB with visualization.
- Observing the manipulation constraints on motion workspace of rigid link required a need of cable driven manipulation.
- Developed 7 RPS cable driven neck brace model.
- Improved the forward and inverse kinematics as well as dynamics upon various iterations of methods used and optimized for better motion manipulation .
